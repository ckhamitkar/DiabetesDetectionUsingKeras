In this project, we’ll use the Python Keras library to create neural networks and use them to predict diabetes with patient health data.

We’ll load and analyze the data using pandas, visualize it using matplotlib and seaborn. We’ll perform data cleaning, preprocessing and feature selection, and then split it into training, validation and testing datasets using NumPy. After the data is ready, we will train simple deep learning models using Keras. We will then plot the training curves and perform model evaluation using scikit-learn.
